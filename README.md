#### Instructions:
Congratulations! You've decided to treat yourself to a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii! To help with your trip planning, you need to do some climate analysis on the area. Use Python and SQLAlchemy to perform basic climate analysis and data exploration of your climate database. Perform an analysis of precipitation in the area. Perform an analysis of stations in the area. Design a Flask API based on the queries that you have just developed.
Use Flask to create your routes. 

#### ------------------
In order to do this assignment, I had to use a few different types of files that would in turn work together. I used a ".py" file and connected to a SQLite database. Using Flask, I created a website which produced various routes. I think it is very important to learn how all the tools we are learning can be used to work together and this assignment demostrated that very well!
