In order to do this assignment, I had to use a few different types of files that would in turn work together. I used a ".py" file and connected to a SQLite database. Using Flask, I created a website which produced various routes. I think it is very important to learn how all the tools we are learning can be used to work together and this assignment demostrated that very well!
